  This project was developed to streamline the process of <a href="https://github.com/sharanya02/Text-file-to-handwritten-pdf-file"> Sharanya's</a> python script that converts a .txt file to a handwritten PDF. However, I have taken the liberty to upload my own handwriting and built a VERY simple utility that would convert any .txt file to my handwritten PDF.
